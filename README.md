### What I learned

So far I did not know how to make a hole in a normal element, seeing that the design of the counter had one I had my serious doubts about whether to simply paint it on the card or make a real hole, the result was that, looking at stackoverflow, I found a really new technique for me, and I think the result was pretty cool.
